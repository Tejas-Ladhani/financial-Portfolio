# financial-Portfolio
F.FIT is a web application that helps you manage your money easily. It is a tool that helps you create and manage your monthly budgets without any hassle. It just requires your gross monthly income and then it automatically makes breaks up that amount as per a given ratio.

## Motivation
The reason behind choosing this as our project was because we observed that people generally don’t consider themselves good with money and don’t want to deal with it themselves and hence we thought why not make a tool that makes this process less frustrating and more intuitive, hence we decided to make a web application that can help them do that easily.
